# INSIGHT_Challenge
## Summary
*
The challenge forbade usages of libraries like pandas. 
I decided to create my own dataframe data structure so I 
could store and query the .csv input files. Once I finished
creating the data structure, the remaining analysis became
trivial. I wrote an analytics class to better organize the 
code. New analytical functions can be easily addded. The default
analysis calculates the required percentage.
